  This script can be used to generate the .nka files needed to support the
  fast-mode versions of the Math Library functions. To use this script, you
  must first compile it using Nils Liberg's KScript Editor (KSE) V1.5.2 or
  higher (new compiler mode). Since this script imports the KSP Math Library,
  V451, you must have it positioned alongside this script (or edit the import
  path accordingly).

  Prior to running this script, make sure that the hosting instrument has
  been set up with a resource Data folder to receive the .nka files that
  will be written. Once the resource Data folder has been properly setup
  and the instrument is pointed to it, you can compile this script in the
  KSE and then paste the compiled script into the desired script slot of
  the instrument and hit Apply. To write any given .nka file to the resource
  Data folder, select the file type you want to write using the drop-down
  menu. When you click the menu selection, the corresponding .nka file will
  be written. Repeat this for each nka file you want to write.
  
  V450 of the Math Library uses features of the new KSE compiler to
  preserve the .nka file names whether or not you use the compact name
  option of the KSE. With this script as supplied, it will write the .nka
  files with the names FLog.nka, FExp.nka, or FSin.nka regardless of
  whether you use the compact name option. However, if your host script
  will import the Math Library 'as xxx', you will need to make the following
  edits to this 2-line script in order to write the nka file names properly.
  
  1. Edit the import line by appending the 'as xxx'.
  2. Edit the macro invokation line write_nka, changing it to xxx.write_nka
  
  For example, if your host script will import the Math Library 'as Math', you
  need to edit this script as follows:
  
  import "KSPMathV451.txt" as Math
  Math.write_nka

  With the above edits, this script will write the nka file names as:
  Math__FLog.nka, Math__FExp.nka, or Math__FSin.nka. These are the correct
  names required by an application that imports the library 'as Math'.
         
  If you follow the above instructions, the .nka files will be named properly
  for your host script to access them (via the Math Library). Remember, you
  cannot achieve the same thing by simply renaming the Standard .nka files
  because K4 embeds the original array name when it writes the file so it
  cannot be loaded later into an array with a different name. Please refer to
  the V450 User's Guide for more information on how to use this script. }
