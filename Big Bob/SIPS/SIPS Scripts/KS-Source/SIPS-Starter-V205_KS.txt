This script can provide automatic (or at least semi-automatic) startup of SIPS 2.
If you include this script (ahead of the SAS) when you save an instrument that uses the
SIPS scripts, upon loading the instrument, this starter script will provide the
needed CC event to start the trio of SIPS scripts. It will also provide an automatic
restart whenvever you recompile any SIPS script (via the Apply button). However, if you
just reload one of scripts, it itself will not be able to start and you will see the
familiar 6x6 panel asking you to wiggle a CC.
